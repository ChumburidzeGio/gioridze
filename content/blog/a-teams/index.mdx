Professionals in most fields are divided into 4 categories based on their seniority levels. Let’s see how they can execute task A:

- **Juniors** - don’t know “how” and “why”. They are fully dependent on their mentor, can do some part of A, and learn fast in the process.
- **Mediors** - know some “how” and a bit of “why”. Usually overconfident, tend to follow trends and without supervision from the Senior, they will make some version of A with lots of flaws, fixing which will cost more than actually re-doing it in most cases.
- **Seniors** - know very well “how” and has a good understanding of “why”. They can deliver A exactly the way you wanted, but without leadership from Experts, they won’t be able to build A-class products.
- **Experts** - great “how” as well as “why” thanks to multi-domain knowledge (“T shape” in marketing). They have a deep expertise in number of fields and can solve problems in creative ways. They can see a bigger picture, create a strong foundation, and instead of A deliver B which will be a much more creative approach and bring 10x growth.

## How to build a team?

Mediors seem to be the most attractive to companies due to their high confidence and low cost. They tend to be the easiest to find as well, but you want someone to build a foundation, set rules, and lead the team so Experts are the best people to hire first.

Don’t hire Mediors after experts, they will slow them down, and if you hire several Mediors, in the process of dealing with them Experts will burn out and leave the company.

The best is to hire Seniors after the Expert, and when the team is strong and stable you can add Mediors, who can bring results in 4-6 months after joining the team, learn fast from Seniors and eventually become one. With the right guidance, it takes less than a year usually from Medior to Senior level.

Mostly you don’t want to hire Juniors, you can do it with very mature teams where training a complete beginner won’t affect team's overall productivity.
