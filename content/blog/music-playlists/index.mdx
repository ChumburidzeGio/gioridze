Generally, you have been adding music to likes or you created playlists based on genres.

I’ve done the same for years and so have millions of other people but scientists (me) for years looked for the solution and here it is.

### Finding the starting point
Whenever find the song you can listen for the next few weeks treat it as a starting point song or SPS and add create based on it our new playlist.

Now recall all songs that are very similar to the SPS that you liked in the past and add them the playlist as well.

End goal is having 7-8 songs at least before the Spotify recommendation engine starts picking the tempo.

### Look into album and popular
Check the album of that specific song, albums are a great way to rediscover the song you already like and put it into perspective.

Artists usually make albums like a story so if you love the 4th chapter it's always wise to read the whole book.

Look as well into popular songs of the artist, you might find there other great songs similar to our SPS.

### Look into similar artists
If you already added to the playlist 7-8 songs or more, you can skip this step, if no then look into “Similar artists” and try to find similar songs to SPS from other artists and add them to the playlist.

### Enhance playlist
Use suggestions from “More recommended songs” and also use “Enhance” mode to add more songs to the playlist that Spotify starts suggesting.

Recommendation engine of Spotify is pretty decent and in few minutes after creating a playlist you will already have lots of great recommendations similar to SPS you can add to the playlist.

### Filtering out the playlist
At this point you probably have 30-40 songs at least in the playlist, now listen to it on the shuffle mode and simply enjoy!

On the way if you find that you don’t really enjoy some song or it has a different mood from others, remove it from the playlist.

### Recap
Creating playlists based on the genre, artist or anything else is tough, creating playlist around SPS is simpler as you can easily leverage recommendations and also you are not restricted to one specific genre - there can be plenty of songs from different genres that are similar to SPS and give the same feeling, have same mood.

Enough talking, create your first SPS playlist and let me know how it works for you.

For inspiration a few playlists I created recently:
